# Animations Directory

This directory contains Rive animation assets for the PickleMatch app.

## Suggested Animations:
- loading_spinner.riv - Loading animation for app startup
- ball_bounce.riv - Ball bouncing animation for game elements
- paddle_swing.riv - Paddle swing animation for game actions
- celebration.riv - Victory/celebration animation
- menu_transition.riv - Menu transition animations

## Placeholder Files:
Since actual binary Rive files cannot be created through this interface, 
placeholder files are created to prevent build errors.

To complete the setup:
1. Replace placeholder files with actual .riv animation files
2. Create animations using Rive editor (rive.app)
3. Export animations as .riv files
4. Ensure animations match the app's pickleball/tennis theme
