# Images Directory

This directory contains image assets for the PickleMatch app.

## Required Images:
- logo.png - App logo used in login screen

## Placeholder Files:
Since actual binary image files cannot be created through this interface, 
placeholder files are created to prevent build errors.

To complete the setup:
1. Replace placeholder files with actual image assets
2. Ensure logo.png is a proper PNG image file
3. Add any additional images needed for the app
